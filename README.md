cd MultiPageForm
```
## install packages

npm i
This will install your node modules and other dependencies.
```
### install react-slick
```

npm install react-slick --save Or yarn add react-slick
 
React slick is a carousel component built with React. It is a react port of  slick carousel. This is for creating coursels.
```
#### include css
 ```
After you are done installing through yarn or npm, now you will have to include CSS in your project.

npm install slick-carousel --save 
 
Note: But be aware slick-carousel has a peer-dependancy on jQuery which you, or your colleagues may not like to see in your console output, so you can always grab the CSS from there and convert it into any CSS in JS solution that you might be using.
```
#### Run npm
```
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
